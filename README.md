# MiniJam_August
Used my ideas from 2 and 3 mini jams ago and reused them!  

#### Version 0.0   
A new block will be given to you when the bar reaches the top, you can place it during the placement phase.  
During the destruction phase you can place a piece to destroy all blocks of that colour.  
Right click to get rid of a block that you don't want anymore.
